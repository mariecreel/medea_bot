Of all creatures that can feel and think,
we women are the worst treated things alive
we bid the highest price in dowries
just to buy some man
to be dictator of our bodies
How that compounds the wrong!
I hope that you will think of me some day when you yourself are suffering.
I hope the fleece will vanish like an idle dream, down into Erebus.
And may my avenging Furies chase you from your home and so repay me for all I have endured through your inhumanity
Why does this grief come upon me, poor wretch?
Whether he be the best of heroes now about to perish, or the worst, let him go to his doom.
Yet I would that he had escaped unharmed; yea, may this be so, revered goddess, daughter of Perses, may he avoid death and return home;
but if it be his lot to be o'ermastered by the oxen, may he first learn this, that I at least do not rejoice in his cruel calamity.
Poor wretch, how have gloomy dreams affrighted me!
I fear that this voyage of the heroes will bring some great evil.
My heart is trembling for the stranger.
Let him woo some Achaean girl far away among his own folk;
let maidenhood be mine and the home of my parents.
Yet, taking to myself a reckless heart, I will no more keep aloof but will make
trial of my sister to see if she will entreat me to aid in the contest,
through grief for her own sons; this would quench the bitter pain in my heart.
Chalciope, my heart is all trembling for thy sons, lest my father forthwith destroy them together with the strangers.
Slumbering just now in a short-lived sleep such a ghastly dream did I see—may some god forbid its fulfilment
and never mayst thou win for thyself bitter care on thy sons' account
God help thee, what healing can I bring thee for what thou speakest of,
horrible curses and Furies? Would that it were firmly in my power to save thy sons!
Be witness that mighty oath of the Colchians by which thou urgest me to swear,
the great Heaven, and Earth beneath, mother of the gods, that as far as strength lies in me,
never shalt thou fail of help,
if only thy prayers can be accomplished.
Chalciope, as is dear and delightful to thee and thy sons, even so will I do.
Never may the dawn appear again to my eyes, never mayst thou see me living any longer,
if I should take thought for anything before thy life or thy sons' lives,
for they are my brothers, my dear kinsmen and youthful companions.
So do I declare myself to be thy sister, and thy daughter too, for thou didst lift me to thy breast
when an infant equally with them, as I ever heard from my mother in past days.
But go, bury my kindness in silence, so that I may carry out my promise unknown to my parents;
and at dawn I will bring to Hecate's temple charms to cast a spell upon the bulls.
Poor wretch, must I toss hither and thither in woe? On every side my heart is in despair;
nor is there any help for my pain; but it burneth ever thus.
Would that I had been slain by the swift shafts of Artemis before I had set eyes on him,
before Chalciope's sons reached the Achaean land.
Some god or some Fury brought them hither for our grief, a cause of many tears.
Let him perish in the contest if it be his lot to die in the field.
For how could I prepare the charms without my parents' knowledge?
What story call I tell them? What trick, what cunning device for aid can I find?
If I see him alone, apart from his comrades, shall I greet him?
Ill-starred that I am!
I cannot hope that I should rest from my sorrows even though he perished;
then will evil come to me when he is bereft of life.
Perish all shame, perish all glow; may he, saved by my effort, go scatheless wherever his heart desires.
But as for me, on the day when he bides the contest in triumph,
may I die either straining my neck in the noose from the roof-tree or tasting drugs destructive of life.
But even so, when I am dead, they will fling out taunts against me;
and every city far away will ring with my doom, and the Colchian women, tossing my name on their lips hither and thither,
will revile me with unseemly mocking—the maid who cared so much for a stranger that she died,
the maid who disgraced her home and her parents, yielding to a mad passion.
And what disgrace will not be mine? Alas for my infatuation!
Far better would it be for me to forsake life this very night in my chamber by some mysterious fate,
escaping all slanderous reproach, before I complete such nameless dishonour.
